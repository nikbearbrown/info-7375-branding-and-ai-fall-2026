# FRICTIONAL — Professor Bear's process log

## Executive summary

**What this is.** The honest process log for the work in this folder, written the way the course asks students to write theirs: what was tried, what went wrong, what changed, and who did what — the human or the AI.

**Why read it.** It is a real example of the log, not a constructed one. It shows the instructor's own work run through the same record students keep, including the parts that did not go smoothly.

**What it records so far.** One session, 2026-09-26, during a live class demo: setting this folder up, bringing the Figma dream-job recipe over from the Prompt Engineering class, and consolidating everything of the instructor's into this one folder. No Assignment 3 work has started yet — that folder is a place to work, not a result. Two findings were about the repository rather than the assignment: `fall-2026/` was blocked by a `.gitignore` rule, so anything put there would have pushed nothing with no error; and the instructor's work existed in two places at once, which is not how the other two classes are laid out.

Every push to GitHub is listed at the bottom with its date and commit note.

### 2026-09-26 — Setting up the Fall 2026 submission folder for a live class demo

- **Date and what I was working on:** Picking up the Figma advocate thread from last week, then setting up the folder the class demo would push to.

- **I tried / expected:** I asked where we were, and said: *"I think we were working on looking at developer advocate positions at Figma. And related companies."* I expected to find my own subfolder already on GitHub. Then: *"While you're looking, see if there's a frictional log on the uh, GitHub. I want to create a new folder on the GitHub under the Nick Bear Brown subfolder. Called assignment three."*

- **What happened:**
  - **Last week's work was all pushed.** The Figma advocate search (seven company job boards, three applicant-tracking systems) is on GitHub in this repo under `assignments/nik-bear-brown/`, and the machinery is in the Reallocation Engine. Nothing was left dangling.
  - **There was no Frictional log for this course's example work.** This repo has the `frictional/` teaching module and a blank `templates/FRICTIONAL.md`, but no filled log for my own work. The Prompt Engineering and Computational Skepticism repos each have one; this one did not. So the honest answer to "is there a frictional log on the GitHub" was: for the other two classes yes, for this class no.
  - **My work was in the wrong folder.** I looked at `https://github.com/nikbearbrown/info-7375-branding-and-ai-fall-2026/tree/main/fall-2026` and said: *"I don't see uh, either my name Nick Bear Brown or uh, [assignment] Three subfolder there. Create one."* The Assignment 2 work had been put under `assignments/nik-bear-brown/`, which is not where the course tells students to submit. The course's own instruction, in `fall-2026/README.md`, is `fall-2026/first-name-last-initial/assignment-XX/`.
  - **`.gitignore` would have silently swallowed the demo.** The rule `/fall-2026/*` ignores everything in `fall-2026/` except its README. Anything created there for the live demo would have been invisible to `git add` with no error — the class would have watched a push that contained nothing.

- **What I did:**
  - Pointed at the Computational Skepticism repo's `fall-2026/nik-bear-brown` as the model: *"look at this as a model how to set up subfolders and frictional logs."*
  - Said where the demo runs: *"I'm doing a live demo in class and this is the folder we're going to push to and work in,"* and how the folder is named: *"nik-bear-brown My subfolder should be named like this."*
  - Had the `.gitignore` rule added that makes this one folder public (`!/fall-2026/nik-bear-brown/`), matching the line the Computational Skepticism repo already uses. Student folders under `fall-2026/` stay untracked.
  - Created `fall-2026/nik-bear-brown/` with the three files the model folder has — `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `FRICTIONAL.md` — and an empty `assignment-3/` to work in.
  - Decided what Assignment 3 is for beyond the grade: the visual identity system closes the exact gap Assignment 2 found in my own CV against the Figma Designer Advocate posting — *never shipped a design system with tokens*. The tokens file and specimen become portfolio evidence, not a throwaway.

- **What Claude or another person contributed:** Claude Code (Opus 5) checked that last week's commits were pushed, searched both repos for a Frictional log and reported that this one had none, found the `.gitignore` rule that would have blocked the demo folder, read the Computational Skepticism folder as the model, and wrote this folder's README, CLAUDE.md, and the first draft of this entry. I decided the location, the folder name, the model to copy, and that the demo happens here. I have not yet reviewed the Assignment 3 plan, and no Assignment 3 work exists yet.

- **What I understand now / still do not understand:** A submission folder is not a place until `.gitignore` agrees it exists — worth saying out loud in class, because a student who creates `fall-2026/their-name/` in a repo with that rule will push nothing and see no error. Still open: whether to move the Assignment 2 and advocate work from `assignments/nik-bear-brown/` into this folder so everything sits in one place, or leave it and link. Also still open: which running brand Assignment 3's palette and type serve, since that decision comes from Assignment 2's positioning.

- **Evidence and next step:** This folder — `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `assignment-3/` — and the `.gitignore` line that tracks it. Last week's evidence is in `assignments/nik-bear-brown/assignment-2/evidence/` and the engine's `reports/greenhouse-watch/`. Next: the Assignment 3 creative brief and `tokens.json`, built live.

### 2026-09-26 (same session, continued) — Bringing the Figma recipe over from Prompt Engineering, and one folder instead of two

- **Date and what I was working on:** After the first push went live, moving the Figma dream-job work into this class and fixing the folder layout.

- **I tried / expected:** I said: *"copy [the Prompt Engineering fall-2026/nik-bear-brown folder]. We're going to build on the Figma from the other. That's also being done in other class. So it took it the look at this particular folder here and copy it over to branding and AI."* And, so the class could watch: *"When you have something to push to the branding and AI folder, push it. I want to show it while you are working on other things."*

- **What happened:**
  - **The recipe was written in the wrong class.** The Prompt Engineering folder holds an eight-step dream-job recipe whose steps are explicitly mapped onto **Assignment 2, "Plan Your Madison Project Like a Pro"** — which is *this* course's assignment, not that one's. Copying it here puts it where it is graded.
  - **The two folders disagree about which posting to pick.** The recipe suggests **Designer Advocate, Partnerships** (the only Figma role that builds certification and enablement programs and appears at workshops). Last week's write-up picked the **Designer Advocate** US-hubs posting and kept Partnerships as "consider." Both judgments are defensible. The disagreement is now stated in the README instead of one quietly overwriting the other; I have not picked yet.
  - **I thought the folder name was wrong.** I said: *"Looks like you misspelled my name… Look at how it's spelled. And the other directories… you also missed it for twenty twenty-six as fall two two six. Look at the other directories for the proper naming… The same thing is being done both in the computational skepticism class and in the prompt engineering class."* Checked against GitHub: the live folder is `fall-2026/nik-bear-brown/`, character for character the same as the other two repos. The spelling and the year were right.
  - **What was actually wrong was that there were two of them.** This repo had `assignments/nik-bear-brown/` *and* `fall-2026/nik-bear-brown/`. Neither of the other two classes has an `assignments/<name>/` folder at all. Two folders with my name is what I was looking at.

- **What I did:**
  - Copied `figma/`, `facts/`, and `greenhouse-watch-demo/` from the Prompt Engineering folder into this one, unchanged.
  - Rewrote this folder's README around the eight-step recipe, with Assignment 2's four parts mapped to the steps that feed them, and the two candidate picks side by side.
  - Added the Prompt Engineering folder's standing rules to `CLAUDE.md`: every value labeled record / judgment / your input, every JSON file indented so students can read it on GitHub, saved boards and run output never hand-edited, and the facts file attested with a date.
  - **Moved `assignment-2/` and `advocate/` here with `git mv`**, moved the Figma book repo with them, deleted the old `assignments/nik-bear-brown/`, and rewrote every link that pointed at the old location. One folder now, like the other two classes.

- **What Claude or another person contributed:** Claude Code did the copy, the README rewrite, the move, and the link fixes, and checked the live GitHub tree to establish that the folder name was already correct rather than agreeing with me. I gave the direction: copy the Prompt Engineering folder, push as you go, and make the naming match the other classes.

- **What I understand now / still do not understand:** The naming was fine; the duplication was the bug, and it was mine — last week's work went into `assignments/` before this folder existed. Resolved: everything of mine is in `fall-2026/nik-bear-brown/`. Still open: which of the two Figma postings is the submission's dream job, the "why this role" sentence, and whether the six-company sweep gets refolded into this folder's per-company shape.

- **Also in this session — the standard submission files.** I asked for *"all of the standard readmes and frictional logs, the other ones have in that as well."* The course's own brief names them, and `templates/` holds blanks for them, so `assignment-3/` now carries `PREDICTIONS.md`, `VERIFICATION.md`, `CONTRIBUTIONS.md`, and its own `FRICTIONAL.md` alongside the README. The prediction (a contrast failure at the smallest caption size on a mid-tone background) and the acceptance criteria are both written **before** anything has been rendered, which is the order the assignment is actually testing. A copied blank template is not evidence, so each one is filled in with what is true today — including "not run yet" where that is the truth. I have not reviewed the drafted prediction.

- **Evidence and next step:** `figma/`, `facts/`, `greenhouse-watch-demo/`, `assignment-2/`, `advocate/`, and `assignment-3/` with its four records, in this folder; the README's recipe and mapping table. Next: pick one of the two Figma postings, then the Assignment 3 creative brief and `tokens.json`.

### 2026-09-26 — This folder stopped being a place to edit shared code

- **Date and what I was working on:** Keeping one live-coded project consistent across three classes.

- **I tried / expected:** I expected the three `nik-bear-brown` folders to be roughly the same.

- **What happened:** They had drifted. Branding had the collector, the watch list, the filter, and the ATS notes; Prompt Engineering had the CV facts and the earlier iterations but not the collector; Computational Skepticism had neither. I named **Computational Skepticism the canonical master**, which meant the master was the folder furthest behind at the moment it was declared.

- **What I did:** The shared spine now lives in the master and is copied here by its `lectern/sync.sh`. This folder gained a `SYNC.md` saying it is **not** the master, and a Rule 0 in `CLAUDE.md` saying the same. The files that are copies are named there. Everything specific to this class — this log, the README, the assignment folders, the dated run outputs — is never copied in either direction, because a log overwritten by another class's log is a destroyed record.

- **What Claude or another person contributed:** Claude Code (Opus 5) inventoried and diffed the three folders, built the sync script, and wrote the notes. I decided which class is master.

- **What I understand now / still do not understand:** Drift is invisible until something diffs it. Still open: the recovery path — a shared file edited in the wrong repo — has not been exercised.

- **Evidence and next step:** `SYNC.md` here, and `./lectern/sync.sh --check` in the master reporting all three in sync.

### 2026-09-26 — Reading the rejects: the audit found a false-positive problem instead

- **Date and what I was working on:** The one check left in my own acceptance criteria. 3,358 postings were rejected in the 2026-09-26 run and nobody had looked at what the filter threw away. I asked for a random sample: *"Give me a hundred or two hundred of the three thousand three hundred postings. Uh, as a random sample. So I can take a quick look at them to see what's being missed."*

- **I tried / expected:** I expected to read 100 rejects and find a handful of missed teaching roles — false negatives.

- **What happened:** The sample has not been read yet. But building it exposed two things first, and the second one is not what I was looking for.

  - **`education` is in 618 of 618 Anthropic postings.** Every Anthropic ad ends with *"Minimum education: Bachelor's degree or an equivalent combination of education, training, and/or experience."* So the topic word carries no information on that board — the same boilerplate problem already found on Writer's board, and most of the reason **950 rejects matched exactly one teaching word**: the word was `education`, in a salary footer.
  - **The topic-word rule is keeping recruiters, not teachers.** 79 of the 88 kept records were kept on a role word in the title. The other 9 were kept on topic words alone, and on inspection most are wrong: three Stripe **University Recruiter** postings, Notion's **Head of Early Career Recruiting**, OpenAI's **Integrated Marketing Manager, Youth Culture**. `university`, `campus`, and `student` are recruiting vocabulary as much as teaching vocabulary. Only Anthropic's **Head of Technical Training** is a clear true positive in that group.

  So an audit aimed at false negatives found a **false-positive** problem instead, in the part of the rule I had paid least attention to.

- **What I did:** Had `lectern/audit_rejects.py` written as a stored script rather than an ad-hoc query, so the sample is reproducible: seed `20260926` recorded in the output, and rerunning reproduces the same 100 rows. Two parts on purpose — a uniform random 100 (the only part that supports a rate: k MISSes means about k × 34 across all rejects) and all 63 of the closest calls, the rejects that matched two teaching words against a bar of three. The 950 one-word rejects are counted, not listed.

  Both findings are written into the sample file as calls for me to make. **Neither has been changed in `keywords.json`** — adding `education` to Anthropic's ignore list would move the flagship company's counts, and demoting `university`/`campus`/`student` would move the kept total, so both are mine to decide rather than something to quietly fix.

- **What Claude or another person contributed:** Claude Code (Opus 5) wrote the sampler, drew the sample, and found both problems while checking the snippets. It also stopped its first attempt: the near-miss tier was 1,013 postings, well past the 100–200 I asked for, so Part 2 was narrowed to the 63 closest calls. It did not change the filter, and it did not mark a verdict on any row — the Verdict column is empty and mine.

- **What I understand now / still do not understand:** The reason to read rejects is not only to find what was missed. Reading them showed what boilerplate looks like from the other side, and that led straight to a false-positive class I would not have found by looking at the 88 keeps. Still open: the actual reading, the two calls above, and whether `university`/`campus`/`student` should require pairing with a real teaching word before they count.

- **Evidence and next step:** `reject-audit-2026-09-26.md` — 100 random rows plus 63 closest calls, Verdict column blank; `lectern/audit_rejects.py` in the master, synced to both other classes. Next: read it, mark the MISSes, multiply, and decide the two calls.

### 2026-09-26 — Auditing by job title instead of by posting, and finding the bug in my own audit

- **Date and what I was working on:** The reject audit. I had a 163-row sample to read and did not want to read it, because reading postings is the wrong unit: *"Seems a better way to look for false positives would actually be to look at the job titles. Because they're probably less job titles than jobs… if we can sort of group and classify groups of job titles it means I don't have to look at 3,000 jobs I can look at a much smaller set of job titles."*

- **I tried / expected:** I expected normalising titles to collapse 3,446 postings into a few hundred, because the same job is posted per city.

- **What happened:** Normalising did almost nothing — 3,446 postings, 3,082 distinct titles, and only 2,701 after stripping locations and seniority. Titles are too varied for that. What worked was the other half of my idea: **classify titles into job FUNCTIONS.** Eighteen families cover every posting, so the read became "judge 18 rules, then read only the rows where the filter and the rule disagree."

  **Then the audit found a bug in itself, not in the filter.** The first pass treated *training* as a teaching word and reported **27 rejected "education" jobs** — which read as a serious false-negative problem. They were *Pre-training Data Infrastructure Engineer*, *Research Engineer, Production Model Post-Training*, *Training Runtime Foundations*, *Researcher, Training*. **At an AI company "training" means training a model.** The filter had been right about all 25 of them; my classifier was wrong. `ML_TRAINING` is now the first family rule for exactly that reason.

  With that fixed, the matrix says: **45 false positives, 2 candidate false negatives, 527 postings in families where the word genuinely means two jobs.**

  The false positives are systematic, not scattered — one word misbehaving across a whole family:
  - **13 SALES_ENABLEMENT + 7 TECH_ENABLEMENT.** `enablement` means sales support or making a system capable. Twenty of the 88 keeps.
  - **9 EDU_SALES.** Canva's *Higher Education Account Executive*, *K-12 Education Account Manager*. Selling into schools is not teaching in them.
  - **2 RECUITING.** Stripe's *University Recruiter*, Notion's *Head of Early Career Recruiting*.
  - The rest are scattered — 5 ENGINEERING, 3 MARKETING, 2 PRODUCT, 2 G&A.

  Only **two** candidate misses in the whole board, and both are real candidates: Notion's **[Contract] Language Training Specialist – Japanese**, which is literally a teaching job on a contract, and Anthropic's **Technical Documentation and Content Engineer, Claude Docs**, which is developer education under a different name.

- **What I did:** Had the family rules written as `lectern/title_families.json` — each family declares whether it expects keep, reject, or *judge*, with a note saying what the word actually means in this industry — and `lectern/audit_titles.py` to apply them and print only the disagreements. Both in the master, synced to the other two classes.

- **What Claude or another person contributed:** Claude Code (Opus 5) measured that title normalisation would not collapse the problem, built the family classifier, and caught its own `training` error when the 27 "misses" turned out to be ML jobs. It reported that error rather than quietly fixing the regex. I supplied the design: classify functions, not postings.

- **What I understand now / still do not understand:** Two words carry nearly all the damage in this filter, and both are false friends in this specific industry: **`enablement`** (sales support) and **`training`** (model training). `education` is a third — meaningless in Anthropic's Logistics footer, and misleading in Canva's sales titles. Sorting by function made all three visible at once, which reading 163 sampled postings would not have. Still open: the 527 *judge* rows, the two candidate misses, and whether the 45 false positives get fixed by cutting `enablement` or by requiring it to pair with a teaching word.

- **Evidence and next step:** `title-audit-2026-09-26.md` — the family matrix and the three disagreement tables, Verdict columns blank. `lectern/title_families.json` and `lectern/audit_titles.py`. The random sample `reject-audit-2026-09-26.md` still stands; sorting by function is cheaper but only finds errors in families someone thought to name. Next: rule on `enablement`.

### 2026-09-26 — The target becomes "makes the materials", and a bullseye that one word had been hiding

- **Date and what I was working on:** Sharpening what the collector is actually looking for, after the title audit surfaced Anthropic's *Technical Documentation and Content Engineer, Claude Docs*.

- **I tried / expected:** I said the Anthropic role *"looks perfect"* and named the real target: *"anything like that have an eye looking for jobs like that. in any kind of company, they'll probably be called something different. But developing materials, either to sell into universities or to sell to the public, or to train their own people would be a great fit."* Then, seeing Replit's role: *"learning experiences creator seems like a great fit as well… everything's probably named differently, but that kind of job would be something to look out for."*

- **What happened:**
  - **I reversed one of my own findings.** "To train their own people" means the 13 sales-enablement postings the last pass called false positives are not errors — building curriculum and running training for internal staff is the work, and the audience being internal does not change it. `SALES_ENABLEMENT` now expects *keep*; the 9 education-sales roles moved to *judge*, because an account executive with only a quota is still a reject and one who builds the materials the sale runs on is not.
  - **This family is nearly invisible by title.** `documentation` appears in **2 of 3,446 titles**. `technical writer`, `curriculum`, `instructional design`, `courseware`, `knowledge base` appear in **zero**. The Anthropic role is almost unique. So the title vocabulary had to grow and a body rule had to exist.
  - **Replit's *Learning Experiences Creator* had been rejected over one word** — the list held `learning designer`, not `learning experiences`. It is as close to a bullseye as this board has. Every candidate word was measured against all 3,446 titles before being added: eleven appear in zero titles and so cannot add noise; `creator`, `documentation`, and `content engineer` each appear in exactly one title and it is the right one. Rejected as measured noise: bare `learning` (42 titles, nearly all Machine or Reinforcement Learning) and `content strategy` (3, all regional SEO marketing).
  - **The body rule failed, twice, before it worked.** First version: **101 extra postings at roughly one-in-ten precision** — all 15 Anthropic *Applied AI Architects* on *technical content* + *our users*, four IT Support Engineers on *how-to guides*, plus tax counsel and incident managers. Tightened to two high-specificity phrases: **zero** hits in the entire corpus. One phrase: 9 hits, 4 right. Cut `how-to guides` and two others: **5 hits, 4 right.**

- **What I did:** `keywords.json` is now v0.4.0 with the measured title words and a two-part `materials_rule` — a make-materials phrase **and** a named audience, both required, because *maintain documentation* in a tax director's ad has the first and not the second. Added a `MATERIALS` family to `title_families.json`. Every phrase that was cut is recorded in the file with the count that condemned it.

  The pass added five roles worth reading: Anthropic's Claude Docs engineer, Replit's Learning Experiences Creator, Stripe's Training Program Manager (Mexico City, *instructional design*), and OpenAI's two AI Deployment Manager (Builder) posts plus its Developer Experience Engineer, Cyber (*create tutorials*). 3,446 postings, **97 kept**.

- **What Claude or another person contributed:** Claude Code (Opus 5) measured every candidate word before adding it, built and then dismantled its own body rule across three attempts, and reported each failure with the postings that caused it rather than quietly adjusting until the number looked reasonable. It also flagged that my "train their own people" remark contradicted its earlier false-positive call, instead of leaving the contradiction in the files. I set the target.

- **What I understand now / still do not understand:** Five words are false friends in this industry and between them they caused every error so far: `training` (model training), `enablement` (sales support, or a system gaining a capability), `education` (a degree requirement in a footer, a sales vertical at Canva), `learning` (machine learning), `content` (SEO marketing). Also worth saying: only the rule that failed obviously ever got measured. "Role word in title" and "three topic words" still have no precision figure, and they carry 92 of the 97 keeps. Still open: 535 postings in *judge* families, and whether the two unmeasured rules deserve the same treatment the body rule got.

- **Evidence and next step:** `keywords.json` v0.4.0 with its `removed_after_measurement` record, `title_families.json` v0.2.0 with the MATERIALS family, the regenerated `title-audit-2026-09-26.md` (27 false positives, 1 candidate miss, 535 to judge), and `quality-report-2026-09-26.md`. Next: measure the title rule the way the body rule was measured.

### 2026-09-26 — Ranking companies instead of postings, and Google's absence was an artefact

- **Date and what I was working on:** Deciding what the good candidates actually are.

- **I tried / expected:** I had been handed a shortlist filtered on remote and full-time, and that is the wrong filter. I said so: *"don't use full-time or purely remote as a flag… I'm going to make the argument that if they want me enough, they'll figure out a position. I'm just looking for the indication that this is something that the company wants… I think if I'm good enough, they'll make a role for it."*

- **What happened:**
  - **The unit of analysis was wrong, not just the filter.** A posting is not a slot to squeeze into; it is evidence that a company has decided this work is worth paying for. So the report should rank **companies**, with location and employment type as context that never excludes anything.
  - **Five kinds of evidence, and the strongest is an org-chart fact.** SELLS (an education revenue line, so a budget) · ENABLES (it trains its own staff) · ADVOCATES (it pays people to teach a public) · TEACHES (it hires teachers and materials-makers) · **BUILDS (it staffs an education *product* team)**. A company showing four or five has an education business, not a vacancy. **Anthropic is 5 of 5** with 15 signal roles. Stripe, Canva, OpenAI, and Notion are 3 of 5. Figma is 2 of 5 but 9 roles.
  - **The first version of that table missed BUILDS entirely**, and undercounted OpenAI at 2 signal roles out of 830 — while OpenAI has a *ChatGPT Education & Learning* engineering team, a *Tech Lead Manager, Education*, and an *Applied AI Architect, Education*. Those were classified as ENGINEERING and dropped. A company staffing an education product team is the best evidence there is, and the report had been blind to it.
  - **Then I pointed out the hole: Google.** *"Google has to be pushing this hard. Integrating Google products like NotebookLM with education."* Google was absent from the table — and absence read as no demand when it actually meant unreadable.
  - **Google has no public JSON feed.** Three endpoint shapes tried, all 404, and I stopped rather than guess more. **But its careers site is readable by a person**, and one search settles it: **20 education roles on the first page** — Google for Education product managers and engineers, *Head of Industry, Education*, *Product Marketing Manager, Google Classroom*, two *Brand Marketing Manager, AI Education* posts, *Brand Marketing Manager, Educator Social*. A search for *NotebookLM* returns six more including **Senior UX Researcher, Learning Frontiers, LearnX** — a Google learning organisation not visible from outside at all. On the demand measure Google belongs at the top of the table and is missing only because of an API.

- **What I did:** Had `lectern/demand_report.py` written to rank companies on the five kinds, with a section stating plainly that absence from the table is a measurement gap and using Google as the worked example. Added an `EDU_PRODUCT` family so BUILDS is counted. Widened the TEACHING pattern, which had been dropping *Head of Technical Training* into UNCLASSIFIED. Google's manual check, its search URL, and its date are recorded in `sources.json` so the claim is re-checkable by hand.

- **What Claude or another person contributed:** Claude Code (Opus 5) built the company ranking, found that its own first version had missed the BUILDS category, tried and failed to find a Google feed, said so instead of inventing one, and then read the careers site in a browser to get real evidence rather than leaving a caveat. I supplied the correction that mattered: rank companies, not postings, and never exclude on employment type.

- **What I understand now / still do not understand:** The filter had quietly encoded an assumption I do not hold — that a job must already be the right shape. Dropping it changes the output from a shortlist of six into a ranked argument about which conversations are worth having. Also worth saying: the nine unreadable companies are now the most important gap in the whole project, because four of them are the deepest education players on the list, and Google shows how badly the table misleads when they are silently missing. Still open: whether a browser-driven reader for Google, Adobe, Salesforce, and GitHub is worth building, or whether checking four careers pages by hand once a month is the honest answer.

- **Evidence and next step:** `company-demand-2026-09-26.md` (18 companies, 5 kinds, 57 signal roles, plus the Google section), `lectern/demand_report.py`, `title_families.json` v0.3.0 with EDU_PRODUCT, `sources.json` with Google's manual check. Next: decide the unreadable-companies question, and measure the title rule.

### 2026-10-07 — The three-class sync check: nothing changed here

- **Date and what I was working on:** The job-search example, kept in sync from the Computational Skepticism master.
- **I tried / expected:** Professor Bear asked for all three classes to be checked and brought into sync, with the master updated from the others and all three pushed: "All three classes should be in sync." I expected this folder, which has the most run data, to be the one with changes the master lacked.
- **What happened:** Nothing here was uncommitted, and every shared file in `assignment-3/` and `facts/` was byte-identical to the master, including `demand_report.py`. The one drift found was in Prompt Engineering, which was missing that script. This folder's extra files (the raw ATS downloads, the reject and title audits, the company-demand report, the advocate notes, the Figma book) are this class's own work by the `SYNC.md` rule and were correctly not copied anywhere.
- **What I did:** Nothing was edited here. The master's sync list gained `demand_report.py` and its `sync.sh` was run for real for the first time; it copied nothing into this folder because this folder already matched.
- **What Claude or another person contributed:** Claude Code ran the comparison in all three folders and reported the result; this entry records that the check was run and what it found. Pushed under the approval given on 2026-09-26.
- **What I understand now / still do not understand:** A folder with the most data is not therefore the one that has drifted. Still open: nothing here.
- **Evidence and next step:** the master's `./lectern/sync.sh --check` reporting "All three in sync." on 2026-10-07.

### 2026-10-07 — Gru's software design document for the whole project, in silent mode

- **Date and what I was working on:** 2026-10-07. A software design document for everything being built under the job-search project, to be the source for the next film. The next film is not a journal log; it is a detailed overview of what is being built.
- **I tried / expected:** I pasted the Gru prompt and said: "Run Gru in silent mode to generate a detailed software development document. Talk about Gru in a log after that … And add that SDD to the three folders on the GitHub." I expected a design document in the form Gru's `/g1` produces.
- **What happened:** Claude Code ran the Gru prompt in silent mode: no intake questions, no pushback, no phase gates. It read the collector, its configuration, the audit scripts, the sync script, the earlier Lectern design document, the status report, the engine's skill and the three logs, then compiled sixteen sections and a seventeenth that Gru's format does not have: where the earlier design and the built code disagree. That comparison found two real gaps. The earlier design describes a seen-id state file and a "what is new since last time" report, plus `--dry-run` and `--all` flags; `collect.py` has none of them. And the collector's docstring says it writes a quality report, but `main()` writes only the `all-jobs` and `jobs-of-interest` files; the dated quality report on file was written outside the collector. Need N2, "see only what changed since the last run", is therefore unserved by the built tool.
- **What I did:** The document is `SDD-job-search-project.md` in the Computational Skepticism folder, the master. I added it to `lectern/sync.sh`'s shared list and ran the sync, so the Branding and Prompt Engineering folders hold an identical copy; `sync.sh --check` reports all three in sync. Each repository is committed by hand with this entry. The Computational Skepticism push is on my word, given in the message above.
- **What Claude or another person contributed:** I supplied the Gru prompt and the instruction to run it silent, to log it, and to add it to the three folders. Claude Code ran the prompt, read the files, wrote the document, changed the sync list and wrote this entry. This is Claude Code's run of Gru, not my answers to Gru's questions, and I have not reviewed the document. Unfilled fields are marked `TODO`, not guessed.
- **What I understand now / still do not understand:** Not yet stated by me. What the compile found: the built tool and its earlier design differ in the two ways above; there are fourteen open questions in section 16, all mine. Claude Code did not run the collector, the audits or the sync for any counts in the document; they are quoted from the 2026-09-26 run files and the status report.
- **Evidence and next step:** `SDD-job-search-project.md` in each folder; `lectern/sync.sh` in the master. Next: I read it, decide the open questions that matter first (a schedule, the five unreadable companies, and whether to build the state and diff or strike it from the earlier design), and the next film is built from this document.

### 2026-10-10 — Assignment 1 worked example, drafted from the CV and the project record

- **Date and what I was working on:** 2026-10-10. The Assignment 1 worked example for Branding and AI — professional introduction, skills inventory, Madison proposal, brand baseline and goals, tools setup — in `assignment-1/`, as markdown instead of the Figma board students submit.
- **I tried / expected:** Professor Bear said: "use my CV and everything you know about the project so far to do assignment one for branding and AI, put it in the assignment one folder." I expected to draft, commit, and log in one pass.
- **What happened:** Muse drafted all five files from the attested CV facts file (`facts/professor-bear-cv.json`) and the project record — the 58 kept postings for market awareness, the Madison repo's actual five-layer structure for the proposal. The first push attempt failed: the GitHub token returned 403 on every write while reads still worked — the fine-grained PAT had lost Contents write scope. Bear supplied a fresh token through the secure connect box; the retry pushed all five files. He has not reviewed the draft.
- **What I did:** Wrote `assignment-1/` (README plus four part files), one commit per file; this entry is committed with the log update.
- **What Claude or another person contributed:** Muse (this session) drafted everything; the Madison component choice (Intelligence Agents layer), the skills self-ratings, and the 176-word proposal are Muse's modeling of the example, not Bear's words. Bear supplied the CV and the direction.
- **What I understand now / still do not understand:** The draft is deliberately honest where unverified — design systems rated 2/5, Jobscan/Canva/Adobe marked TODO. Still open: Bear's review of the draft.
- **Evidence and next step:** `assignment-1/` in this folder, five commits. Next: Bear reviews; the A5 brief work continues.
